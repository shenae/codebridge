<div id="gallerytext">Adopted and born on the same day as the twins, Randall (played by Sterling K. Brown) had challenges growing up as black kid. He made up for being abandoned as a baby, becoming a stellar student and college graduate.  Leo was also abandoned at a young age. And because he is older than the furry twins, he is the  the most intelligent one.</div>
