<div id="gallerytext">Being the supermom and devoted wife, Rebecca Pearson (Mandy Moore) did everything she could after the death of her huband to keep it together. Finding love again later in life with Miguel was a suprise for everyone, including her kids. As a single mom to three furry babies, her role resonates with me. And starting a relationship with javascript has been tough but rewarding. </div>
