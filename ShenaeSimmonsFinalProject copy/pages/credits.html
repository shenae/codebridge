	<p>All photos from the television show should be credited to NBC, The Hollywood Reporter, and People Magazine. Photos of my cats were taken by me! I would love to mention Heavenly Angels Animal Rescue in Queens and North Brooklyn Cats because that is from where my furry babies were adopted.  Please donate to the ASPCA and let me name drop our fellow CodeBridge class member Wayne's pet rescue organization, Pawsome Pet Rescue. Shout out to my furry babies, Celimene, Arsinoe and Leo for being my support and being forever cute. And last but certainly not the least, my boo, JavaScript.</p></div></div>
