<div id="gallerytext">As the only daughter, Kate (played by Chrissy Metz) is the glue that keeps "Pearson 3" together. She is just as talented as her brother  with a great singing voice. Kate is always there to help everyone except herself. Celimene is also the only girl in the family and has a deep connection with her twin brother. She is definitely in charge of grooming her brothers and loves looking at birds in the window.</div>
